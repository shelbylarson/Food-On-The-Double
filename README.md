# Food-On-The-Double


Food on the Double is an interactive recipe app that provides convenient recipes that can be made in 10 minutes

or less! We chose Food on the Double as the name of our app to appeal to busy people that need quick and easy 

recipes. We built this app so that we could have one spot where we could find a quick recipe without having to 

search the web for one. 

//App Icon

For the icon, we went with a very simplistic vector icon. We have a lot of pictures in our app, so we wanted a 

very clean icon image.

||Instructions||

When you open the app, click the "Go to my recipes" button, which will direct you to a screen with 4 recipe 

categories: appetizer, entree, dessert, and drinks. Click on any one of the categories; doing so will take you 

to a different screen with six unique recipes which correlate with their category. There is a back button on 

the navigation bar which will take you back to the previous screen if you desire to find recipes under a 

different category. Clicking on any one of the six pictures will bring up the ingredients and directions of 

how to make that food or drink. You can scroll to view longer recipes. Again, there is a back button on the 

navigation bar to take you back to the recipes. 

||The Coding Process||

This app was built off of the Playlist Browser app that Treehouse built in Objective-C. We ended up deleting

most of the code and built the majority of our app in the storyboard. We attempted to have a much cleaner 

storyboard and utilize one view where it changed depending on the recipe clicked, but due to lack of time, we

were unable to make that idea functional. This app was very time consuming to build, so we split up the 

responsibilities. Shelby was over the overall design, especially editing the many pictures used, and Aleya and

Chynese put everything into the storyboard and ensured the app ran properly.
